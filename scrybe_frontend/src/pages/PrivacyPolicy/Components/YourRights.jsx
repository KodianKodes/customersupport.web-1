          {" "}
          You have a right to consent to this Policy and to withdraw your
          consent at any time. However, your withdrawal of consent shall not

          You have a right to a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you, as

          and how long we hold it for, provided you show us/forward the proof of
          your identity. We may make a reasonable charge for additional copies
          of that data in the case of unfounded and excessive requests.
