        We will not store or collect your payment card details. That information
        is provided directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of
        your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy. These
        payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by
        the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands
        like Visa, Mastercard, Verve. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the
        secure handling of payment information.
