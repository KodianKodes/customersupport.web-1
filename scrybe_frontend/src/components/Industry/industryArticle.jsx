            Additionally, decision-making, planning, negotiation, and creative
            thinking are all impacted by the emotional state of the brain.

            In order to succeed in business, we must comprehend and
            individualize experiences. Humans are biased, which is where
            artificial intelligence comes into play. Emotional AI is used to
            accurately and bias-free comprehend the customers.

          <p>
            <a href="https://www.uniphore.com/emotion-ai/">Emotional AI</a> is
            the application of artificial intelligence algorithms to
            psychometric data and is used by marketers and customer service
            teams in customer acquisition and retention efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The complexity of the human mind may be studied using computational
            power, just like any other machine. In order to understand the
            intricacies of human thought and decision-making, emotional AI
            combines the strength of analytics. This gives you the ability to
            design more perceptive interactions that are suited to the
            requirements of your users (and their quirks).
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding customer sentiment and brand loyalty can be done
            effectively using analytics. In today&apos;s cutthroat business
            environment, a company&apos;s ability to both attract and retain
            customers directly depends on how it handles its current customers.
