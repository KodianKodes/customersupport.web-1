        Disclosure of Confidential Information
      </h3>
      <p className={styles.paragraphs}>
        In connection with providing the Service, it may be necessary or
        desirable for you or Scrybe to disclose to the other certain non-public
        Confidential Information. For purposes of these Terms, ‘Confidential
        Information' shall mean all non-public, confidential and proprietary
        information relating to the Parties, their respective clients and the
        Service, which has been or will be disclosed by a Party orally or as set
        forth in writing, or contained in some other tangible form. The
        receiving Party agrees to keep all Confidential Information disclosed by
        the disclosing Party in strict confidence and to use all rational
        efforts to keep it secret, and may not disclose Confidential Information
        without the express, written prior consent of the disclosing Party, with
        the exception of the following:
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraphs}>
        Information that was previously known to or in the knowledge of the
        receiving Party at the time of disclosure and was not obtained, directly
        or indirectly, from the disclosing Party is information that the
        receiving Party can prove by prior record.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraphs}>
        Information that is already public knowledge at the time of disclosure
        or later becomes public knowledge due to publishing or another method,
        other than the receiving Party violating this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraphs}>
        Information that the receiving Party learns from a third party,
        provided, however, that this third party did not learn the information
        from the disclosing Party directly or indirectly while under a
        confidentiality duty to the disclosing Party.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraphs}>
        Information that the receiving Party can prove was autonomously created
        by their staff members or outside contractors who were not in touch with
        and were not aware of the Confidential Information's contents.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraphs}>
        If required to do so by a court, administrative agency, or other
        tribunal of competent jurisdiction, the receiving Party may disclose
        Confidential Information; provided, however, that in such a case, the
        receiving Party shall, immediately upon receiving notice that disclosure
        may be required, give written notice to the providing Party by printed
        and overnight mail so that the providing Party may seek a protective
        order or other remedy from said court or tribunal.In any case, the
        receiving Party shall only divulge that portion of the confidential
        information that, in the judgment of their legal counsel, is required by
        law to be disclosed, and will take all reasonable steps to ensure that
        any such information so disclosed will be treated confidentially by said
        court of law through protective orders, filings under seal, and other
        suitable means.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraphs}>
        The receiving Party must only use the confidential information to
        provide, enhance, or create new services in connection with the service.
        Only the receiving Party's officers, employees, agents, service
        providers, or affiliated firms, as applicable, who have all agreed to
        terms that are at least as strict as these Terms, will be given access
        to confidential information.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraphs}>
        The receiving Party shall take all appropriate efforts to ensure that
        the Confidential information isn't divulged or duplicated for the use of
        any third party, including, but not restricted to, those steps taken to
        protect their own data, information, or other tangible or intangible
        property that they regard as proprietary or confidential. The receiving
        Party shall also take all reasonable steps to prevent their directors,
        officers, employees, and agents (as pertinent) who have access to the
        Confidential Information from disclosing or duplicating the Confidential
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraphs}>
        The receiving Party must promptly return all materials and documents,
        along with any data or other media (including computer data and
        electronic information), to the disclosing Party upon written request.
        Alternatively, the receiving Party may choose to eviscerate said
        Confidential Information and provide a certificate of destruction upon
        request from the disclosing Party.
